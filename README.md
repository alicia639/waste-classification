# Waste Classification App

A neural network machine learning model classifies different types of waste, and then the program shows where it goes in Vancouver's recycling program.

## The Machine Learning Model
The model was trained using tensorflow. The dataset used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification). The training of the model can be found in the garbage-classification notebook file above.

## The App
Users can upload a file and then the app will classify it using the machine learning model, with additional output.
